# mnestic

**mnestic** is an independently maintained fork of
[CozoDB](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo) — a transactional,
relational-graph-vector database that uses Datalog for queries ("the
hippocampus for AI"). The fork continues the project as a substrate for
**agentic memory**, with performance, correctness, and operational work on top
of upstream `481af05` (the last upstream commit, 2024-12-04).

## What mnestic adds over CozoDB

Upstream's last commit was 2024-12-04. mnestic continues the engine, with these
capabilities on top of it:

- **Cached graph projections** — `::graph create G { edges: knows }` names an
  in-memory adjacency that twelve graph algorithms reuse across queries instead
  of rebuilding on every call. Always fresh: a projection never serves data
  differing from what the consuming transaction's own scan would return, and a
  write to a source frees what was built from it.
  ([spec](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/docs/specs/graph-projection.md))
- **Bitemporality** — a `TxTime` column type with a crash-safe monotone commit
  clock, `:as_of` reads, the two-level `(valid time, transaction time)`
  resolution, and `::history` / `::history_gc` / `::evict`.
  ([spec](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/docs/specs/bitemporality.md))
- **Provenance semirings** — user-defined absorptive combines inside recursion
  (`Db::register_custom_aggr`), the `min_cost_k` bounded-meet aggregate returning
  the *k* best derivations with their evidence chains, and `:reconcile`
  recompute-based belief revision.
  ([spec](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/docs/specs/provenance-semirings.md))
- **In-engine hybrid retrieval** — reciprocal-rank fusion over vector, full-text
  and graph legs as one Datalog-composable fixed rule, with MMR diversification.
- **Read-only Cypher** — an openCypher subset translated to CozoScript (alpha;
  feature `cypher`, off by default).
  ([spec](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/docs/specs/cypher-read.md))
- **Faster lookups and plans** — equality pushdown turns post-filter point
  lookups into keyed seeks (~28× at 5k rows), plus a deterministic greedy join
  reorder and an opt-in factorized `count()` rewrite.
- **Non-blocking vector index builds** — HNSW builds in RAM in parallel and no
  longer blocks reads for minutes; search-path neighbour vectors batch-fetch
  through RocksDB `MultiGet`.
- **Operational recovery** — `::repair_corrupt` surgically deletes truncated
  tuples instead of forcing you to drop a database that fails an integrity check.
- **Interruptibility that works** — `::kill` and `:timeout` abort running
  queries, including long graph-adjacency builds.

Everything else — CozoScript, the storage engines, the data model — is upstream
CozoDB, unchanged unless noted in
[`CHANGELOG-FORK.md`](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/CHANGELOG-FORK.md).

## New in 0.11.0

**Cached graph projections.** Twelve graph algorithms can now take their
adjacency from a named, always-fresh, in-memory projection instead of rescanning
the edge relation and rebuilding a CSR on every call:

```
::graph create g { edges: knows, nodes: person }

?[node, group] <~ ConnectedComponents(graph: 'g')
?[node, rank]  <~ PageRank(graph: 'g', iterations: 20)
```

Measured on a 400,000-edge graph (*cold* is the positional form, i.e. the
previous behaviour):

| kernel | cold | warm | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ConnectedComponents` | 127 ms | 7.9 ms | **16×** |
| `PageRank`, 20 iterations | 150 ms | 10 ms | **15×** |
| `ClusteringCoefficients` | 169 ms | 56 ms | 3× |

What is cached is the setup — scanning the edges and building the CSR — so the
gain shrinks as the kernel itself dominates. Under write churn the cache degrades
to build-per-query; it never goes stale. Projections are in-memory and are not
persisted.

Also in this release:

- **BREAKING (results):** `PageRank`'s default `iterations` is now 20, up from
  10, which was a below-upstream default and measurably non-convergent. Pass
  `iterations: 10` to restore the old numbers.
- **Fixed:** an empty edge relation used to abort the process in seven graph
  algorithms; and `multi_transaction` could deadlock a process by parking a
  `rayon` worker for the transaction's lifetime.
- `PageRank` accepts an optional node relation, so vertices with no edges are
  ranked instead of silently dropped.

Full detail, including the upgrade notes and known limitations, is in
[`CHANGELOG-FORK.md`](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/CHANGELOG-FORK.md).


## Importable name

The published crate is `mnestic`, but the importable Rust crate name is `cozo`,
so existing CozoDB code works unchanged:

```toml
[dependencies]
mnestic = "0.10.7"
```

```rust
use cozo::{DbInstance, ScriptMutability};
```

The query language (CozoScript / Datalog) and engine semantics are unchanged
unless noted in the fork changelog.

## Features

Default is `compact` (SQLite backend). RocksDB, vector (HNSW), full-text search,
and graph-algorithm features match upstream Cozo 0.7.x. See the crate docs and
the [upstream CozoDB documentation](https://docs.cozodb.org/) for the query
language and feature flags.

# mnestic fork changelog

Divergences from upstream CozoDB `481af05` (2024-12-04). See `FORK.md` for
provenance and licensing.

## Unreleased

### Fork bootstrap
- Forked from `cozodb/cozo` at `481af05`; full history preserved, upstream
  remote retained as `upstream`, fork point tagged `fork-base`.
- Renamed brand and core package from `cozo` to `mnestic`. Original MPL-2.0
  per-file copyright notices preserved.
- Added `FORK.md` (provenance/attribution) and this changelog.

### Audit of MindGraph's drafted upstream bugs against the fork point

The drafts in `mindgraph-rs/docs/upstream_bugs/` were written against the
**crates.io 0.7.6 release**. Our fork point (`481af05`) is the upstream `main`
HEAD, which is **30 commits ahead of the `v0.7.6` tag** (Ziyang merged fixes
after the release but never cut another version). Each draft was therefore
re-verified against HEAD with a backend-correct reproducer:

| # | Bug | Status at fork HEAD | Evidence |
|---|-----|---------------------|----------|
| 3 | `mat_join` joins on wrong symbols (silent 0 rows) | **Already fixed** by the PR #286 "fix-stored-prefix-join" cluster | `tests/matjoin_regression.rs` passes; plan now emits `stored_prefix_join {"**2":"uid"}` instead of `stored_mat_join {"**2":"**0"}` |
| 1 | Equality post-filter → full scan, not prefix lookup | **Was present; now FIXED in the fork** (measured ~28–29× at 5k rows) | fix in `query/reorder.rs`; `tests/fork_regressions.rs::equality_post_filter_uses_prefix_lookup` now active — see "Shipped" below |
| 2 | top-level `:create _foo` silent no-op | **Present, but is a scoping nuance** — `_`-relations are legitimate transaction-scoped temporaries (work across imperative `{...}` blocks). Only the top-level form is a silent trap. Fix is a design call. | `tests/fork_regressions.rs::top_level_create_underscore_relation_is_a_silent_noop` (ignored) |
| 4 | Secondary-index puts: N separate `.put()` calls | **Present** (perf 2-3×) | `cozo-core/src/query/stored.rs` still loops `store_tx.put()` per index |
| 7 | `hnsw` serial neighbor fetches | **Present** (perf 10-20% HNSW) | `cozo-core/src/runtime/hnsw.rs::VectorCache::ensure_key` still single-key `handle.get()` |

Note: the fork being 30 commits ahead of the released 0.7.6 means simply
adopting mnestic already gives MindGraph bug #3's fix (and the other unreleased
fixes) for free.

### Shipped in the fork
- **#1 equality-pushdown for stored relations** (`query/reorder.rs`). Equality
  post-filters on a stored relation — `*rel[k, ..], k == <ground>` and
  `*rel{k, ..}, k == <ground>` — now compile to a keyed `stored_prefix_join`,
  identical to the binding-first form `k = <ground>, *rel{..}`. Upstream left
  these as a full `load_stored` scan + `eq(..)` post-filter. Implemented as a
  pre-pass (`push_equality_filters_to_bindings`) that converts qualifying
  `eq(var, ground)` predicates into unifications and hoists ground equality
  unifications ahead of the relation that produces the variable; the existing
  well-ordering logic then emits the prefix lookup. Pure optimization — result
  sets are unchanged. (NB: the fix is in `reorder.rs`, not `relation.rs::choose_index`
  as originally guessed — `choose_index` only selects *secondary* indices.)
  - **Measured** (criterion, SQLite backend, 5000-row relation, single-row PK
    lookup): positional post-filter **1.746 ms → 61.1 µs (~28.6×)**; brace
    post-filter **1.756 ms → 59.4 µs (~29.5×)**; binding-first unchanged
    (~48–51 µs). The speedup scales with row count (O(N) scan → O(log N) lookup).
  - Tests: `tests/fork_regressions.rs::equality_post_filter_uses_prefix_lookup`
    (now active, was `#[ignore]`); baseline bench `benches/point_lookup.rs`.
- **#287 `env_logger` moved to a dev-dependency** (`cozo-core/Cargo.toml`). It was
  a hard dependency but is only used by `runtime/tests.rs` (cfg(test)). Closes
  upstream cozo #287; trims downstream build graphs.
- `tests/matjoin_regression.rs` — regression guard pinning the #3 fix.
- `benches/point_lookup.rs` — first stable/CI-runnable criterion bench (the
  upstream pokec/wiki/time_travel benches need nightly `#![feature(test)]` +
  external datasets, so they don't run in CI).

### Next (ordered by value/confidence)
- **#4** batch secondary-index writes into a single `WriteBatch` — perf, needs the cozorocks bridge to expose batch put.
- **#7** `multi_get` for HNSW neighbor fetches — perf, needs bridge support.
- **bit-rot**: #307 (benches don't compile on the 3-arg `run_script`), #298 (rayon cargo-update break), #281 (`nullable…` column binding parser bug).
- **#2** decide + implement the top-level temp-create behavior (warn vs error vs surface scope).

# mnestic (Python)

Embedded **graph + vector + full-text** database with **Datalog** queries — a
maintained fork of [CozoDB](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo), tuned as a substrate
for **agentic memory**. This package is the in-process Python binding (no server
required).

```bash
pip install mnestic
```

```python
from mnestic import CozoDbPy

db = CozoDbPy("mem", "", "{}")  # engines: "mem", "sqlite" (file path), "rocksdb" (dir path)
db.run_script("?[x] <- [[1],[2],[3]]", {}, False)

# One-call hybrid retrieval (HNSW + full-text fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion),
# over a relation that has an HNSW index and an FTS index:
hits = db.hybrid_search({
    "relation": "docs",
    "vector_index": "vec", "query_vector": [0.1, 0.9], "vector_k": 5,
    "fts_index": "fts", "query_text": "vector search", "fts_k": 5,
})
# -> {"headers": ["id", "score"], "rows": [["d3", 0.033], ...], "next": None}

# Pass "detailed": True for per-leg contributions — one row per (item, leg)
# with the within-leg rank the fusion used and the leg's raw score:
# headers ["id","score","list_id","leg_rank","leg_score"]
```

The `"rocksdb"` persistent backend now ships in the published wheel —
`CozoDbPy("rocksdb", "./my.db", "{}")` works straight from `pip install mnestic`.
The source distribution stays SQLite/`compact`-only, so the persistent engine is
wheel-only.

**Upgrade note (0.10.6):** a persistent database whose relation catalogs were
last written by a build older than 0.10.0 could fail to open with `Cannot
deserialize relation metadata from bytes` after upgrading to 0.10.0–0.10.5.
0.10.6 fixes this — legacy catalogs open again with no migration, so upgrade to
0.10.6 if you carry a pre-0.10.0 database.

`run_script` takes an optional `timeout=` — a per-query wall-clock budget in
seconds; on expiry the query raises an `eval::timeout` error.
`db.set_default_query_timeout(secs)` sets a Db-wide default and
`db.default_query_timeout()` reads it back; the effective budget for a query is
the minimum of that default and any per-call `timeout`.

**New in 0.11.0: cached graph projections.** Run
`db.run_script("::graph create g { edges: knows, nodes: person }", {}, False)` to
name an in-memory adjacency that twelve graph algorithms reuse across queries:
pass `graph: 'g'` in place of the positional edge relation
(`ConnectedComponents(graph: 'g')`, `PageRank(graph: 'g', iterations: 20)`, …)
and the setup — scanning the edges and rebuilding a CSR — is paid once instead of
on every call (measured 15–16× on a 400,000-edge graph). A projection is always
fresh: a write to a source relation frees what was built from it, and it lives
only in memory. `::graph list` and `::graph drop` manage them, and
`db.set_graph_projection_capacity(bytes)` sets the cache's ceiling (512 MiB by
default; `0` disables caching while leaving `::graph create` working).
**Breaking (results):** `PageRank`'s default `iterations` is now 20, up from 10;
pass `iterations: 10` to restore the old numbers.

For idiomatic LangChain / LlamaIndex usage, install the integration packages
(`langchain-mnestic`, `llama-index-vector-stores-mnestic`).

The query language (CozoScript / Datalog) and engine semantics follow CozoDB; see
the [upstream documentation](https://docs.cozodb.org/) and the
[fork changelog](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/CHANGELOG-FORK.md).

# mnestic (Python)

Embedded **graph + vector + full-text** database with **Datalog** queries — a
maintained fork of [CozoDB](https://github.com/cozodb/cozo), tuned as a substrate
for **agentic memory**. This package is the in-process Python binding (no server
required).

> mnestic is **not** the official CozoDB and is not affiliated with or endorsed by

```bash
pip install mnestic
```

```python
from mnestic import CozoDbPy

db = CozoDbPy("mem", "", "{}")  # engines: "mem", "sqlite" (file path), ...
db.run_script("?[x] <- [[1],[2],[3]]", {}, False)

# One-call hybrid retrieval (HNSW + full-text fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion),
# over a relation that has an HNSW index and an FTS index:
hits = db.hybrid_search({
    "relation": "docs",
    "vector_index": "vec", "query_vector": [0.1, 0.9], "vector_k": 5,
    "fts_index": "fts", "query_text": "vector search", "fts_k": 5,
})
# -> {"headers": ["id", "score"], "rows": [["d3", 0.033], ...], "next": None}
```

For idiomatic LangChain / LlamaIndex usage, install the integration packages
(`langchain-mnestic`, `llama-index-vector-stores-mnestic`).

The query language (CozoScript / Datalog) and engine semantics follow CozoDB; see
the [upstream documentation](https://docs.cozodb.org/) and the
[fork changelog](https://github.com/shuruheel/mnestic/blob/main/CHANGELOG-FORK.md).
